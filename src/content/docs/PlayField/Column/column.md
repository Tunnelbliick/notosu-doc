![Column](../../../../assets/images/Playfield/column.jpg)

The `Column` class in a rhythm game playfield represents individual columns which handle their respective receptors, notes, and animations. It provides functionalities for moving, scaling, rotating these elements, and syncing them with the game's rhythm.

## Properties

- `type`: `ColumnType` - Specifies the type of the column.
- `offset`: `double` - X coordinate offset for this column.
- `scale`: `CommandScale` - Scale of the receptor and origin.
- `receptor`: `Receptor` - The receptor object associated with the column.
- `origin`: `NoteOrigin` - The origin point for notes in the column.
- `bpmOffset`, `bpm`: `double` - BPM and offset for timing the receptor glints and note animations.

## Constructor

### Column
Initializes a column with specific properties, creating receptor and origin objects.

```csharp
public Column(double offset, ColumnType type, String receptorSpritePath, StoryboardLayer columnLayer, CommandScale scale, double starttime, double delta);
```

**Parameters:**
- `offset` (`double`): The X coordinate for this column.
- `type` (`ColumnType`): The type of the column, determining its position and rotation.
- `receptorSpritePath` (`String`): Path to the sprite used for the receptor.
- `columnLayer` (`StoryboardLayer`): The storyboard layer where the column will be rendered.
- `scale` (`CommandScale`): The scale of the receptor and origin.
- `starttime` (`double`): The start time for initializing the receptor and origin animations.
- `delta` (`double`): Used for timing adjustments in animations.

## Methods

### setBPM
Sets the BPM for the receptor glint on full beats and adjusts the timing offset.

```csharp
public void setBPM(double bpm, double bpmOffset);
```

**Parameters:**
- `bpm` (`double`): The beats per minute, determining the rhythm timing.
- `bpmOffset` (`double`): The offset in milliseconds for aligning the BPM with the music.

Here is the documentation for each of the new functions you've provided, following the style of the ASTRO documentation you showed:

---

### MoveColumn
Coordinates the simultaneous absolute movement of the receptor and the origin.

```csharp
public void MoveColumn(OsbEasing easing, double starttime, double endtime, Vector2 from, Vector2 to);
```

**Parameters:**
- `easing` (`OsbEasing`): The easing function applied to the movement.
- `starttime` (`double`): The time at which the movement starts.
- `endtime` (`double`): The time at which the movement ends.
- `from` (`Vector2`): The starting position of the movement.
- `to` (`Vector2`): The ending position of the movement.

---

### MoveColumnRelative
Coordinates the simultaneous relative movement of the receptor and the origin by a specified offset.

```csharp
public void MoveColumnRelative(OsbEasing easing, double starttime, double endtime, Vector2 offset);
```

**Parameters:**
- `easing` (`OsbEasing`): The easing function applied to the movement.
- `starttime` (`double`): The time at which the movement starts.
- `endtime` (`double`): The time at which the movement ends.
- `offset` (`Vector2`): The offset by which the column is moved.

---

### MoveColumnRelativeX
Coordinates the simultaneous relative horizontal movement (X-axis) of the receptor and the origin.

```csharp
public void MoveColumnRelativeX(OsbEasing easing, double starttime, double endtime, float value);
```

**Parameters:**
- `easing` (`OsbEasing`): The easing function applied to the movement.
- `starttime` (`double`): The time at which the movement starts.
- `endtime` (`double`): The time at which the movement ends.
- `value` (`float`): The value by which the X-axis position is changed.

---

### MoveColumnRelativeY
Coordinates the simultaneous relative vertical movement (Y-axis) of the receptor and the origin.

```csharp
public void MoveColumnRelativeY(OsbEasing easing, double starttime, double endtime, float value);
```

**Parameters:**
- `easing` (`OsbEasing`): The easing function applied to the movement.
- `starttime` (`double`): The time at which the movement starts.
- `endtime` (`double`): The time at which the movement ends.
- `value` (`float`): The value by which the Y-axis position is changed.

---

### MoveReceptorAbsolute
Manages the absolute positioning of the receptor.

```csharp
public void MoveReceptorAbsolute(double starttime, Vector2 newReceptorPosition);
```

**Parameters:**
- `starttime` (`double`): The time at which the positioning starts.
- `newReceptorPosition` (`Vector2`): The new position for the receptor.

---

### MoveReceptorAbsolute (Overload)
Manages the movement of the receptor from a starting position to an ending position over a specified time period.

```csharp
public void MoveReceptorAbsolute(OsbEasing ease, double starttime, double endtime, Vector2 startPos, Vector2 endPos);
```

**Parameters:**
- `ease` (`OsbEasing`): The easing function applied to the movement.
- `starttime` (`double`): The time at which the movement starts.
- `endtime` (`double`): The time at which the movement ends.
- `startPos` (`Vector2`): The starting position of the receptor.
- `endPos` (`Vector2`): The ending position of the receptor.

---

### RotateReceptorRelative
Manages the relative rotation of the receptor over a specified time period.

```csharp
public void RotateReceptorRelative(OsbEasing easing, double starttime, double endtime, double rotation);
```

**Parameters:**
- `easing` (`OsbEasing`): The easing function applied to the rotation.
- `starttime` (`double`): The time at which the rotation starts.
- `endtime` (`double`): The time at which the rotation ends.
- `rotation` (`double`): The degree of rotation to be applied.

---

These methods and properties provide comprehensive control over individual columns within the rhythm game's playfield, facilitating dynamic animations and interactions that align with the game's music and rhythm.

### Position, Rotation, and Scale at Time Methods (Continued)

**Additional Methods:**
- `OriginPositionAt(double starttime)`: Retrieves the position of the origin at a specific time.
- `OriginRotationAt(double starttime)`: Retrieves the rotation of the origin at a specific time.
- `OriginScaleAt(double starttime)`: Retrieves the scale of the origin at a specific time.
- `ReceptorPositionAt(double starttime)`: Retrieves the position of the receptor at a given time.
- `ReceptorRotationAt(double starttime)`: Retrieves the rotation of the receptor at a specified time.
- `ReceptorScaleAt(double starttime)`: Retrieves the scale of the receptor at a given time.

These methods are crucial for synchronizing the visual elements of each column with the rhythm and timing of the music, ensuring a cohesive and engaging gameplay experience.
