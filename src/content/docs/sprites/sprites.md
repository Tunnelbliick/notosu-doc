# Setting Up the Storyboard Folder for notOSU!

When creating storyboards for osu!mania using notOSU!, organizing your storyboard folder correctly is crucial. Here's a step-by-step guide on setting up your storyboard folder for a notOSU! project.

## Initial Folder Structure

Your storyboard folder should be organized into subfolders for different asset types. Based on the images you've provided, the structure should look like this:

```
sb/
├── sprites/
│   ├── 1.png
│   ├── 2.png
│   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
│   ├── 12.png
│   ├── arrow.png
│   ├── hit.png
│   ├── light.png
│   ├── hold.png
│   ├── hold_body.png
│   ├── receiver.png
└── white.png
```

You can download the default sprites based on Petes Cel [here](https://github.com/Tunnelbliick/notosu/raw/main/sb.rar)

You can find Petes ITG skins [here](https://github.com/Pete-Lawrence/Peters-Noteskins)

### Snaps

notOSU! currently support following beatsnaps `1` `2` `3` `4` `12` `16` and any multiples which will reuse the same sprite like `6` `9` or `24` `36` as example.

Here's what each folder is for:

- `sb/`: This is your main storyboard directory. All storyboard-related assets go here.
- `sprites/`: This subfolder contains all the visual elements you'll use in your storyboard, like hit objects and receptors.
- `white.png`: This is just a 1x1 white pixel that is used for visualisations etc.

## Setting Up Your Storyboard Folder

1. **Create the `sb/` Folder**: This should be within your osu! beatmap directory. It's where all storyboard-related files will reside.
2. **Add Subfolders**: Inside `sb/`, create a subfolder named `sprites/`.
3. **Populate with Assets**: Place your image assets into the appropriate subfolders. For instance, receptor images go into `sprites/`.
4. **Naming Convention**: Make sure your files are named logically, as shown in the structure above. This will help you reference them correctly in your storyboard scripts.

## Using Assets in Your Storyboard

When referencing these assets in your storyboard script, you'll use paths relative to the `sb/` folder. For example, if you're accessing `receiver.png`, the path would be `sb/sprites/receiver.png`.

## Tips for Managing Your Storyboard Folder

- **Keep It Clean**: Only include assets that you will use in your storyboard to avoid clutter.
- **Use Version Control**: If you're working with a team or want to keep track of changes, consider using a version control system like Git.
- **Backup Regularly**: Storyboards can be complex and time-consuming, so make regular backups to avoid losing your work.

By following this guide, you'll have a well-organized storyboard folder that will make your notOSU! project management smoother and more efficient. Happy storyboarding!
